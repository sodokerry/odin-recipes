  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A vegan take on hot honey chicken. Agave syrup replaces the honey in this cruelty-free southern dish. Pair hot honey soy curls with coleslaw and cornbread for a true feast!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <h4>Creamy Coleslaw</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup vegan mayo</li>
    <li>1 tsp white vinegar or apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tsp agave syrup</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups shredded green cabbage</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded carrots</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Sweet Cornbread</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
    <li>1/2 cup organic cane sugar</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>2 tbsp flax meal</li>
    <li>3 tbsp water</li>
    <li>1 cup non-dairy milk, unsweetened</li>
    <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/4 cup agave syrup</li>
    <li>1 cup corn, fresh or canned</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Crispy Hot "Honey" Soy Curls</h4>
  <ul> 
    <li>2 cups soy curls (soaked/drained according to package directions)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup corn starch</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup hot sauce (I used Franks)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vegan butter, melted</li>
    <li>3 tbsp agave syrup</li>
    <li>sa few pinches of salt and pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>First, make the coleslaw. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the vegan mayo, vinegar, agave, and a few pinches of salt an pepper.</li>
    <li>Now add the shredded cabbage and carrots into the bowl. Toss to combine and then put in the fridge while you make the rest. This is a very lightly dressed slaw, but you can add a bit more mayo if you prefer.</li>
    <li>Now make the cornbread. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees(F).</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Then stir in the cornmeal, sugar, and salt. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the flax and water and set aside to thicken for 2-3 minutes. This creates the egg replacer.</li>
    <li>In a medium sized mixing bowl, whisk together the non-dairy milk, vegetable oil, and agave.</li>
    <li>Once the flax meal has thickened, add that to the bowl with the wet ingredients and whisk to combine.</li>
    <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until fully combined. Then fold in the corn.</li>
    <li>Pour into a 9x13 inch baking disk that is lined with parchment paper or sprayed with nonstick spray. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick or knife can be stuck in the center and comes out clean. Let cool completely before cutting into squares.</li>
    <li>While the cornbread is baking, make the soy curls. Once the soy curls have been soaked and drained, squeeze as much water out of them as you can. Then add them to a large mixing bowl.</li>
    <li>While they are still wet, sprinkle the corn starch and a few pinches of salt and pepper over the soy curls. Toss to coat the soy curls completely in the corn starch.</li>
    <li>Heat the vegetable oil on medium high in a non-stick skillet.</li>
    <li>Add the soy curls and fry them until they are brown and crispy, reducing heat as needed. This may take 5-6 minutes.</li>
    <li>While the soy curls cook, in a medium sized bowl, whisk together the hot sauce, agave, and melted vegan butter.</li>
    <li>Once the soy curls are nice and crispy, pour about half of the hot "honey" sauce over the soy curls in the pan. Reduce heat to low, and toss to coat the soy curls.</li>
    <li>Add a little bit of sauce at a time until it has the sauciness you want. I like to save a little to pour on top of my meal. Saut&eacute; in the sauce for just 1-2 minutes. Turn off heat.</li>
    <li>Serve some hot "honey" soy curls with some coleslaw and cornbread.</li>
